  comment: Hi Brandon, do you have a field marked as unique in your mapping? Feeds
    relies on the unique field to determine if a record already exists.

  comment: Hi Mark, I agree with the article you linked to, that the including the
    stylesheet in the .info file is a quick and dirty way to do it. In that sense,
    I&#39;d greatly prefer to use the hook_css_alter() function instead if Magic wasn&#39;t
    an option.

  comment: Hi James, you&#39;re not the first person to suggest Fences to me now.
    I agree with you that using Expert mode will become a maintenance nightmare, especially
    for larger projects. I really want to explore Fences further now. Thank you for
    your suggestions on how to manage field templates across various situations. I&#39;ll
    keep them in mind.

  comment: "Great summary of the DS Field UI. My rule of thumb is sticking to either\
    \ Minimal or Full Reset, and avoiding Expert at all costs. It starts becoming\
    \ a bottleneck on larger projects.\r\n\r\nManaging layouts across several environments\
    \ requires either a manual export step, or re-configuring per environment. Features\
    \ module helps with the former, and the latter is just an incredible time suck.\r\
    \n\r\nIf you&#39;re using the same markup across multiple fields, things get a\
    \ bit out of hand as well. You have to manually configure each field by hand,\
    \ which tends to slow down development. Should any changes happen to that component\
    \ later on, you have to make that change in several places. For me, a module like\
    \ Fences helps catch the majority of situations. Then for more complex design\
    \ patters, using a custom field template and theme_hook_suggestions in preprocess."

  comment: Hi Tanner (I hope I got your name right), you raise a very valid point
    that I didn&#39;t really consider thoroughly. I have yet to reuse fields very
    heavily but I can foresee circumstances where this might occur. Thank you for
    bringing Fences to my attention. I must admit that even though I have heard of
    this module, I have not explored its capabilities much at all. That is definitely
    something I will look into moving forward. I do appreciate your thorough and clear
    explanation of the cons of using DS field template.

  comment: "I have to strongly discourage against taking this approach to managing\
    \ field-level markup (specifically using the &quot;expert&quot; mode). While it\
    \ provides an easy way to get the markup and classes you want when building the\
    \ site, it creates a maintenance nightmare for future development of the site,\
    \ far worse than anything a collection of .tpl.php files in the theme could do.\
    \ With the DS field template approach, all of your markup control is at the field\
    \ instance level, which means if you&#39;re reusing that field somewhere else\
    \ and want some styling applied to both, you have to manually step through that\
    \ 20+ field form to achieve the same markup and classes. Another problem with\
    \ this approach is that all that markup control gets stored in the database rather\
    \ than the theme layer where it belongs. Granted, DS config is exportable with\
    \ features, but controlling markup in this way is far more difficult than managing\
    \ in the theme layer.\r\n\r\nI would strongly recommend using Fences over DS Field\
    \ Template (https://www.drupal.org/project/fences) as you&#39;re still using field\
    \ templates, but in a more manageable way. A key advantage with Fences is that\
    \ the template you choose applies to the field base rather than field instance,\
    \ which means you can achieve semantic markup for a field globally through your\
    \ site, including fields reused across content types, your views, etc. While this\
    \ does still mean relying on config in the database, it&#39;s simply saying what\
    \ template to use rather than storing the entirety of the markup. And since this\
    \ is still using field templates much like you normally would, you can still leverage\
    \ template suggestions to further control your markup as needed."

  comment: Hello Ricardo, thanks for taking the time to read my blog posts. I feel
    the same as you, that there is so much more that I don&#39;t know about Drupal.
    I&#39;m also learning as I write more blog posts and I hope my posts will continue
    to provide value to you. Are there Drupal meetups near where you live? It helps
    to chat with more experienced Drupal developers too :)

    \ I would recommend form some high-impact, low-hanging fruit the following:\r\n\
    o you can configure the Geofield distance calculation to be relative to the visitor&#39;s\
    \ location, as well as an address\r\no you can enable the Leaflet More Maps module\
    \ to instantly add 20+ available maps to just the one available through Leaflet\
    \ -- includes Bing and Google high-res\r\no you can add beautiful animated marker\
    \ clustering with the Leaflet Markercluster module\r\n"
