    been really lucky in terms of the variety of projects I got a chance to work on.

  comment: "Hi there Chen, I am glad I&#39;ve spotted your note on Drupal planet,\
    \ it is very well written!\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to say that you already participated\
    \ in several interesting and challenging projects so it is cool start for 1.5\
    \ years!\r\n\r\nAnd of course it is fine to have blog created by any tool. Drupal\
    \ world, as many other, is very connected with other technologies/tools so this\
    \ is only for good! :)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nDennis"

  comment: Hey, thanks for reading. I was kinda expecting people to ask why this site
    isn&#39;t on Drupal. But I feel that using Drupal for a simple blog is like using
    a Tsar Bomba to nuke a rat  :p
