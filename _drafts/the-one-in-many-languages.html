<p>I&#8217;ve always heard that Drupal did multi-language well, but you know when you hear about something and think, I know of it, but I don&#8217;t know much else about it? That&#8217;s exactly how multi-lingual Drupal was for me. Until we got to work on the <a href="http://www.flysfo.cn/">SFO China site</a>.</p>

<p>At the time, the main SFO site was a single-language implementation. There was some form of multi-language support, but it did not take advantage of Drupal&#8217;s multi-lingual infrastructure. We were brought in to build the entire Chinese language site, as well as ensure the infrastructure was in place so additional languages could be implemented easily.</p>
