I love video games. Maybe I don't play them as much as I used to, but I've been playing video games longer than any of my friendships (siblings don't count). My first video game was an educational game called Treasure by xx, but I soon moved on to games that had significantly less educational value and exponentially more entertainment value, like Commander Keen and Doom. 

It's safe to say that video games made me computer literate. Back then, almost all our games came from shareware on floppy disks. I was probably all of 5 or 6 years old, and at that age, nobody wanted me touching the family PC. But I had sneaked up on my older brother and peeked at the commands he entered to run the games. No prizes for guessing what happened when he left the room.

Eventually, the grown-ups realised that I wouldn't make the computer explode, so they let me muck around the PC quite freely. It's been more than 20 years since, and on my most recent trip back home, I went on a retro-rampage and tried to dust off some of my favourite old games for a trip down memory lane. Some worked, while others couldn't. That's why I'm such a fan of GOG.com, best place to get all your old childhood favourites.

One of my favourite genres was the city-building games, the entire Sierra games series from Caesar III until Zeus, Age of Empires and Settlers 3.
