I love video games. Maybe I don't play them as much as I used to, but I've been playing video games longer than any of my friendships (siblings don't count). My first video game was an educational game called Treasure Mountain by [The Learning Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Learning_Company), but I soon moved on to games that had significantly less educational value and exponentially more entertainment value, like [Commander Keen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_Keen) and [Doom](https://www.gog.com/game/the_ultimate_doom). 

It's safe to say that video games made me computer literate. Back then, almost all our games came from shareware on floppy disks. I was probably all of 5 or 6 years old, and at that age, nobody wanted me touching the family PC. But I had sneaked up on my older brother and peeked at the commands he entered to run the games. No prizes for guessing what happened when he left the room.

Eventually, the grown-ups realised that I wouldn't make the computer explode, so they let me muck around the PC quite freely. It's been more than 20 years since, and on my most recent trip back home, I went on a retro-rampage and tried to dust off some of my favourite old games for a trip down memory lane. Some worked, while others couldn't. That's why I'm such a fan of [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/), best place to get all your old childhood favourites.

One of my favourite genres was the city-building games, the entire Sierra games series from [Caesar III](https://www.gog.com/game/caesar_3) onwards, [Age of Empires](http://aoe.heavengames.com/) and [Settlers 3](https://www.gog.com/game/the_settlers_3_ultimate_collection). I still don't understand why the genre seemed to die off, but that's a different topic for a time. So I managed to get Settlers 3 to boot up on the old family PC and since it'd been what, 15 years? I started off with the tutorial level, just to refresh my memory.

## So you just bought a new game...

I once read this fascinating article on [Gamasutra about knowledge acquisition styles](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/134531/tutorials_learning_to_play.php) and how this influences gamers' experience when they first encounter a new game. Basically, there are 2 different styles of knowledge acquisition, **explorative acquisition** and **modelling acquisition**. The former describes gamers who will just dive head first into the game and figure things out along the way by clicking on everything, trying every button and generally just exploring the new world. The latter describes players who want to know what each button does before he/she presses it. They want to understand the consequences of their actions by observing someone or something else, then replicating those actions to ensure they get the same results.

The article emphasises that modelling players are not *afraid* to learn something new, rather, they need to have an opportunity to understand the risks and rewards before being comfortable with exploring. I've played a lot of games, and I can tell you that there are many different ways tutorial levels are designed. But I want to classify the techniques into having an explicit tutorial level versus having the tutorial built into the start of a new game.
