If you've been following along my latest exploits (though I doubt anyone is), you may know that I'm the co-organiser of [Talk.CSS](http://singaporecss.github.io), the first CSS-centric [meet-up group](http://www.meetup.com/SingaporeCSS/) in Singapore. We've been in existence for around 5 months now and some time last month I thought it'd be a good idea to build a website for our little meet-up group. Sort of a place where people can find out more about us, and check out what happened during our previous meet-ups. Okay fine, it was an excuse for me to build another website, but with the freedom to try all sorts of new technologies.

Since we're a CSS-centric meet-up, the website must have some CSS-related mojo going on, right? (Just kidding, no voodoo involved, just cool code). I'm one of those people who still uses an RSS feed reader. Between that and Twitter, I come across many interesting CSS articles every day. And this website turned out to be the perfect playground for me to try out a lot of the things I read about.
