title: "Reveal.js + GitHub Pages: when developers give talks"

Recently, I was asked to give a talk at a local front-end meetup. I'd never spoken at any meetups before that. Let's just say I've been a devoted member of the audience. Regardless, I figured if I was going to give a talk in front of actual human beings, I probably ought to put some effort into preparing some decent slides to facilitate things. 

For most people, presentation decks are synonymous with Powerpoint, or Keynote for those hipster types (kidding, I'm one of you guys). I was all like, I'm a developer, we don't need no stinking presentation software, we HTML that shit. I guess I'll jump on any reason to play with something new. There are loads of frameworks that let you create really nice presentations as static sites, [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), [Remark](http://remarkjs.com/), [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/), just to name a few. I settled on Reveal.js, simply because. <span class="kaomoji">¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</span>

My idea was to host all my slides on GitHub Pages since my own website was already up there. Using project pages would also make the URL structure appear like it was part of my site, even though they would be in completely separate repositories.
