Most of the projects I worked on in 2015 were either Facebook applications (yes, somehow those are still being made) or based on the [Base Framework]({{ site.url }}/blog/intro-to-base-framework/). I didn't think there'd be much opportunity for me to work with Drupal for client sites moving forward but I was wrong. After almost 6 Drupal-free months, we got a client request to build their website in Drupal. Guess who was put in charge of that project? :sunglasses:
