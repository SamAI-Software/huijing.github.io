The third project I worked on was a website for the Redemption Hill Church. The churchâ€™s site started out as a HTML site, but as more content was added, they migrated to Wordpress a few years back. However, as the site continued to grow, it became apparent that the current structure was sub-optimal in terms of organising the various new content types the site had.

And that's where we came in. By the time I joined the company, the design work had already been completed and the site was ready to be built. There was a spreadsheet that documented each of the various sections and how the content was to be presented. In an ideal world, the content would fit into our design perfectly, all the functionality of the site would work smoothly and all would be well across the land. Too bad unicorns don't exist. 

In retrospect, we made a number of *\*gasp\** assumptions with regards to how the content would behave. There were a couple of issues that we ought to have pre-empted and a couple more that could have been avoided with better communication. But you live, you learn.

After getting my feet wet with the previous two projects, I felt more at ease with Drupal at this point. Although I'd been flying solo up till then, this time, I'd be working with another developer, [Zell Liew](http://zell-weekeat.com/) (this is the origin story of how we became good friends). I would build the site with all its functionality, and Zell would make it look pretty. Zell is essentially the Susy guy, I mean, he did write [a book](http://zell-weekeat.com/learnsusy/) about it. You really should check it out.
