The third project I worked on was a website for the Redemption Hill Church. The churchâ€™s site started out as a HTML site, but as more content was added, they migrated to Wordpress a few years back. However, as the site continued to grow, it became apparent that the current structure was sub-optimal in terms of organising the various content types the site had.

And that's where we came in. By the time I joined the company, the design work had already been completed and the site was ready to be built.
