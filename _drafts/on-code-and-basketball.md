People who got to know me within the past two years may see me as that nerd who loves to code. Fellow developers may think of me as that person with an irrational love for CSS. But for most of my life (even now, to be honest), I was "that basketball player". But I did not grow up in an athletic household. Nobody really did sports seriously. We were a typical Asian family, with typical Asian values of academic excellence. Throwing a ball around, albeit with high levels of skill and precision, didn't net you much in the achievements department.

I started playing organised basketball when I was 13, and that kick-started a journey that made me who I am today. Even though, at the time, it seemed like the elders of the household did not approve of this athletic endeavour, my siblings always had my back. They didn't have to say it, but I felt it from their actions. In hindsight, I know realise how important that support was. Let's just say, I never really had any major self-esteem or confidence issues growing up.

There's a very clichÃ©d saying that basketball doesn't build character as much as it reveals it. I think it does both though. We were playing in the national semi-final in the under-14 school tournament, and we were down by 2 points with the clock winding down. And even though this was 14 years ago, I remember it like yesterday. I demanded the ball and drove to the hoop knowing I would be fouled. If I had made the shot anyway, and got the foul after, things would have been easier for everyone. But, you know, life. If I make both free throws, we would have tied, and who knows what would have happened in overtime. I missed one.  
Shit.  
Season over.

But I knew that I wanted the ball in my hands. I was going to have an impact on the ending regardless. So we lost. I was pretty upset at the time. I remember making 22 free throws in a row the next day. Too little too late though. <span class="kaomoji">Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯</span>

**Life lesson #1**: Things don't always go your way. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off and move on.

I had a 2-hour commute to and from school at the time. And remember Asian values? I landed my ass in a pretty strong academic school and so, schoolwork + basketball + travel-time = ðŸ˜±
I learned pretty early on that trying to do everything at once is a recipe for failure. You'll just end up feeling so overwhelmed you can't finish anything at all. But the ridiculous schedule meant I was forced to learn how to prioritise early on in my life. Think of it this way. It's like when you're playing Assassin's Creed, you don't jump into an area filled with enemy guards, get yourself surrounded and take a beating. It's much easier to pick them off one by one. Same principle. Video games mirror life, people.

**Life lesson #2**: You can do anything. But you can't do everything. Prioritise your tasks, finish each one, and check it off your list.

As a forward/centre, I usually play in the post. The post players and perimeter players usually train separately during individual skills drills. A common complaint from the post players is that the perimeter guys don't pass the ball inside. And the perimeter players complain that the post players don't  At some point, the coaches had enough of that and told everybody to switch places. Meaning, the post players came out to the perimeter and the perimeter players posted up inside.
