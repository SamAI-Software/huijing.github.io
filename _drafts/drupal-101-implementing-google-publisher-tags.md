Ads are an inevitable part of the web. I've been listening to the [Internet History Podcast](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/) by [Brian McCullough](https://twitter.com/brianmcc) a lot lately and there's an entire chapter (the podcast is divided into chapters each covering a theme) dedicated to search engines and advertising. Make sure to catch the supplemental interview episodes of Chapter 4, as those shed a lot of light about why the web turned out the way it did (with so many ads). 

At some point, somebody is going to ask you to integrate ads into the site you're building. There are plenty of ways to do this, and what I'm going to cover is just one of those methods. What we had to work with was a custom ad script given to us by a third-party agency responsible for handling the ad implementation. The client's requirement was to have responsive ads displayed according to the screen size of the device being viewed on. 

In a nutshell, we were required to integrate [tags for responsive design](https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/4578089?hl=en) into a Drupal site. Now, Drupal has a [Google Publisher Tags](https://www.drupal.org/project/gpt) module, but as our goal was to replace an existing ad integration to use GPT, we did not use that module. The use case here involved creating custom blocks for each of our three ad types, so they could be easily placed anywhere on the site. Each block could then be styled as necessary (for positioning and stuff). This functionality would be written in a custom module.

The GPT Javascript library would be called from the <code class="language-markup">&lt;head&gt;</code> tag while each ad slot would be displayed as a block and their corresponding Javascript written in their respective <code class="language-php">tpl.php</code> files.

###Add the GPT scripts to the head of your webpage
<p class="no-margin">Add the GPT Javascript library to the <code class="language-markup">html.tpl.php</code> file of your theme.</p> 
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;!-- Begin GPT --&gt;
  &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
    var gptadslots=[];
    var googletag = googletag || {};
    googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || [];
    (function(){ var gads = document.createElement('script');
      gads.async = true; gads.type = 'text/javascript';
      var useSSL = 'https:' == document.location.protocol;
      gads.src = (useSSL ? 'https:' : 'http:') + '//www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js';
      var node = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
      node.parentNode.insertBefore(gads, node);
    })()
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- End: GPT --&gt;</code></pre>


###Creating the custom module
Here's the [official documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/1074360), which is very comprehensive might I add, for creating your own module. This is the condensed version specific to the above use case.

1. Create a new folder in the modules folder of your Drupal installation folder like so: <code class="language-bash">sites/all/modules/gptad</code>.
2. <p class="no-margin">Create the file <code class="language-bash">gptad.info</code> in the <code class="language-bash">gptad</code> folder.</p>  
    <pre><code class="language-clike">
name = GPT ads
description = Custom module for implementing GPT ads as blocks.
core = 7.x</code></pre>

    <ul>
    <li class="no-margin"><strong>name:</strong> This identifies your module on the modules administration page.</li>
    <li class="no-margin"><strong>description:</strong> This explains what your module does, viewable on the modules administration page as well.</li>
    <li><strong>core:</strong> This is the version of Drupal your module works with. Use 7.x for Drupal 7.</li>
    </ul>
    Refer to [Writing module .info files](https://www.drupal.org/node/542202) for all the additional properties you can include in this file. 
3. <p class="no-margin">Create the file <code class="language-bash">gptad.module</code> in the <code class="language-bash">gptad</code> folder.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php">
&lt;?php</code></pre>
    The functionality of the module will be defined in this file, so the code described in the sections below all go in here.
4. It's a good idea to turn on error reporting while developing. That dreaded [White Screen of Death](https://www.drupal.org/node/158043) never helped anybody debug anything. Add the following lines to your settings.php file:
    <pre><code class="language-php">
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', TRUE);
ini_set('display_startup_errors', TRUE);
</code></pre>

###Creating the ad blocks
If you use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), I highly suggest installing the [Drupal Sublime Text](https://github.com/robballou/drupal-sublimetext) plugin. It provides autocompletion for Drupal snippets.

1. <p class="no-margin"><strong>Define the block on the block administration interface.</strong></p>
    
    <p class="no-margin">The block's properties are defined with the <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21block%21block.api.php/function/hook_block_info/7">hook_block_info</a> function.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php"> /**
 &ast;  Implements hook_block_info
 */
function gptad_block_info() {
  // Define blocks for each ad type
  $custom_blocks = array(
      'ad_01' => 'Banner (728x90) Ad Block',
      'ad_02' => 'Sidebar (300x250) Ad Block',
      'ad_03' => 'Mobile (320x100) Ad Block',
  );&NewLine;
  // All blocks will be initially hidden but can be enabled through panels or context
  foreach ($custom_blocks as $name => $title) {
       $blocks[$name] = array(
         'info' => t($title),
         'status' => TRUE,
         'region' => -1,
         'weight' => 0,
         'visibility' => BLOCK_VISIBILITY_NOTLISTED,
       );
  }
  return $blocks;
}</code></pre>
  The module should now be visible in the modules administration interface.
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/posts/gpt.jpg" alt="GPT block"/>
2. <p class="no-margin"><strong>Add configuration options to your block.</strong></p>
    
    <p class="no-margin">A <em>feed code</em> field was added to allow the feed code to be editable. It would be a simple text field. This can be done using the <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21block%21block.api.php/function/hook_block_configure/7">hook_block_configure</a> function.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-php"> /**
 &ast; Implements hook_block_configure().
 */
function gptad_block_configure($delta = '') {
  $form = array();&NewLine;
  switch ($delta) {
       // Add a feed code field to the ad block
       case 'ad_01':
       case 'ad_02':
       case 'ad_03':
         $form['default_feed_code'] = array(
           '#type' => 'textfield',
           '#title' => t('Enter the feed code for this ad block'),
           '#default_value' => variable_get($variable_name, ''),
         );
         break;
  }
  return $form;
}</code></pre>
3. <p class="no-margin"><strong>Save the inputs from the feed code field.</strong></p>
    The [hook_block_save] function is used when 
    <pre><code class="language-php"> /**
 &ast; Implements hook_block_save().
 */
function gptad_block_save($delta = '', $edit = array()) {
  switch ($delta) {
       // For blocks displaying MSN external feeds, save the default feed code  field
       case 'ad_01':
       case 'ad_02':
       case 'ad_03':
         $variable_name = 'field_feed_code_' . $delta . '_default';
         variable_set($variable_name, $edit['default_feed_code']);
         break;
  }
}</code></pre>
