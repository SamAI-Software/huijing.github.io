Recently, I was [part of a panel](https://e27.co/move-over-wonderwoman-techladies-is-creating-the-next-wave-of-female-supercoders-20160129/) at the launch event for [TechLadies](http://www.techladies.co/), an initiative that encourages women to learn coding. Along the way, I mentioned a bit about my background as an athlete. As we were leaving to go home, the lady next to me jokingly asked if I was a better basketball player or a developer. Without missing a beat, I said basketball player, for sure. I've been playing basketball for more than half my life, I've only been coding for two and a half years.

There is this stereotype of the nerdy programmer with all the brains and none of the brawn. But I'm here to tell you, it's called a stereotype for a reason. English lesson time!

> **ster·e·o·type**  
(noun) a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.

I personally know developers who are avid cyclists, marathon runners, even a mountain climber (the kind who scales Mount Everest). I don't deny that there are many of us who aren't the least bit interested in any athletic pursuits as well, but this applies to all white-collar professions. But this is not about becoming a gym rat, eating only chicken breasts and drinking protein shakes. It's more about being less sedentary. Maybe this post should have been titled, *Being a healthier office worker*.

## Nobody likes pain and suffering

When it comes to exercise or fitness training, you must have heard some people say, oh it's all about self-discipline. You must have the willpower to persevere through the pain. I don't think that's a good strategy for the average person on the street. Trust me, unless you genuinely enjoy pain and suffering, there has to be something that you *want badly enough* to endure pain and suffering. Ask any athlete if they enjoy running extra sprints or lift extra weights, even the Olympic medallists will tell you they don't, **BUT** they do it anyway because they want to be the best.

My point is, forcing yourself to do something you do not enjoy is not sustainable. I'll be the first to admit, I'm not a big fan of running. A little ironic coming from someone who played basketball full-time at one point, but the fact is, the only reason I did any running at all was because competitive basketball required me to. When I stopped training full-time, I simply couldn't muster the energy or motivation to get up and run every day, or even every week, for that matter.

## Do things that take minimal effort

I am lazy. 

I don't know about you, but I'm pretty good at talking myself OUT of doing things that require extra effort to get ready for. For example, going swimming requires that I pack toiletries, a fresh set of clothes, goggles etc. Then actually making it to the pool after work before it closes, which means I have to plan to leave the office on time and so on. Guess what, 8 out of 10 times, I just end up telling myself to go swimming next time.

In contrast, I commute to work on my bicycle. Yes, it helps that I love riding my bicycle. I actually do enjoy swimming, but probably not enough to overcome my laziness. But because cycling is my main mode of transport, I don't even think about it as exercise. It's just something I do as part of my day. Like brushing my teeth.

The "while-you're-at-it" technique works very well for me, and maybe it'll work for you too. Basically, work in your healthy habits into things you're already doing. Like how parents hide vegetables in more palatable meal items to get their kids to eat them.

## Near-zero effort

The following is a list of things that involve minimal effort to do, but have significant returns on investment. Consider them the MVP of healthy habits.

### 1. Drink more water

Most of us have been told to drink 8 glasses of water a day, but how many of us actually do drink that much water? The actual amount of water people need per day seems to be a debatable topic, but I'm going to make the bold assumption that most of us don't even drink more than 1 litre of water a day (around 4 glasses). And please don't tell me coffee is just flavoured water.

This means that most of us are operating at a mildly dehydrated state throughout the day. Studies done on both [men](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21736786) and [women](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/142/2/382.full) have shown that mild dehydration negatively impacts one's mood and cognitive functions. Considering that our job requires significant mental acuity, upping water intake is a minimal effort life-hack with significant benefits.

A lot of times people also mistake thirst for hunger. [Studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849909/) have shown that we're notoriously bad and distinguishing hunger and thirst. Given most of us probably don't drink enough water throughout the day, odds are, half the time you're not really hungry when you reach for that snack. You're actually thirsty. Don't reach for that can of soda though, drink a glass of water.

### 2. Move more frequently than you do now

A [study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-013-2845-9/fulltext.html) done on the effects of sedentary behaviour revealed that long periods of inactivity increases one's risk of diabetes and heart disease. And it also mentions that encouraging individuals to simply sit less and move more, regardless of intensity level may be improve the effectiveness of diabetes prevention programmes.

There are ways to incorporate more movement into your day. Try constantly drinking water throughout the day. Have a water bottle at desk or something. Not only does this fulfil the "drink more water" habit, you'll also find that you need to get up to go to the bathroom more often. And that's movement. Note: do **NOT** refuse to go to the bathroom because you're "on the brink" of solving the bug. It's a lie you tell yourself.

Since you're getting up and sitting down more often, might as well incorporate some exercise while you're at it. Instead of plonking down on your seat when you get back, lower yourself slowly over the course of 5 seconds until your butt touches your chair. You're building leg muscles! Who needs a gym? The point is, all the little things you do to increase movement will add up. You don't have to go all the way to the gym to exercise.

### 3. Don't eat while you work

It might surprise you to know that being aware of what you put in your mouth does make a difference. I know a lot of office workers, not only developers, who will eat lunch at their desks, a spoonful of food in one hand and continuing to type with the other. Lunch has become something that's shovelled into our mouths and swallowed. That's no way to appreciate a meal. Make lunchtime that logical break between your coding sessions. Some may protest that there's just no time to eat. We have to code for 20 hours a day!

First of all, it's not possible to be efficient for 20 hours a day. A [study](http://news.illinois.edu/WebsandThumbs/Lleras,Alejandro/Lleras_sdarticle-17.pdf) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has shown that taking a deliberate break can reboot your focus on the task at hand. It offsets our brain's tendency to fall into autopilot which explains why we can't come up with good solutions after continuously staring at a bug for hours. [Tom Gibson](https://medium.com/@yeptom) wrote a [beautiful post](https://medium.com/@yeptom/we-are-not-linear-processes-f0858a0cda88#.7x5ht6gvr) explaining how human beings are not linear processes. We are still operating on an industrial model where emphasis is placed on hours worked, not output achieved.

> We need to aim for a healthy ‘Work Rate Variability’ and develop models of working that stop making us ill, and instead let us do our best. - Tom Gibson

Also, by actually bothering to chew your food before swallowing, you're eating slower. [Research has shown](http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S2212-2672(13)01673-0/abstract) that eating slowly led to lower hunger ratings and increased fullness ratings. Maybe you'll lose some weight too by having a proper lunch break. This is the power of minimal effort.

### 4. Use a blue-light filter at night

Although I'm personally a morning person, most of my fellow developer friends are night owls. Everybody functions best at different times of the day, but if you're someone who operates better at night, then I recommend installing [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) on your computer and mobile devices. It's a small application that makes the colour of your computer's display adapt to the time of the day. 

Melatonin is a hormone that helps maintain the body's circadian rhythm, which determines when we sleep and wake up. Normally, our bodies produce more melatonin when it gets dark. [Scientists have found](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047226/) that exposure to room light in the evening suppresses melatonin during normal sleep hours. [Research on the effects of blue light](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831986/) have shown that blue light suppresses sleep-associated delta brainwaves while stimulating alertness. Because it doesn't make sense to ask people to stop working at night, the best alternative is to reduce exposure to blue light.

## Minor effort required

If you've managed to or already are incorporating all the zero-effort health habits into your life, and feel like putting in a bit more effort, this section consists of things that take a little more than zero effort.

### 1. Walk

When I started writing code, I found myself glued to my chair for hours on end. You know that feeling when you're debugging something and obstinately refuse to let that bug get the better of you? But I also realised that my efficiency decreases the longer I work on something without stopping. I can't tell you how many times I worked on a bug till I threw my hands up in frustration and went for a walk, only to have the solution come to me as I strolled outside enjoying the breeze.

Walking doesn't require any additional planning or equipment. Most of us can do it without thinking. And the health benefits conferred include a reduction of chronic diseases like [stroke](http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/11/14/STROKEAHA.113.002246) and [heart disease](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/resp.12239/full). As part of your attempt to have a better lunch break, take a walk after you've properly chewed and swallowed your lunch. It [limits the increase of blood sugar levels](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3119587/) immediately after a meal. Who knows, you might lose a few kilos.

### 2. Stretch

I don't know about you, but sitting for long periods of time makes my hips feel tight and back feel uncomfortable. The scientific research on the exact effects of sitting on the structural integrity of your hip flexors seems to be inconclusive, but I know how I feel. A lot of us tend to slouch in our chairs too, so that can't be good for our overall posture.

If you find yourself craning your neck forward at your desk, with your shoulders up near your ears and back rounded forward, news flash! You have terrible posture. So what if your posture is bad? Well, refer to this [handy infographic](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/the-health-hazards-of-sitting/750/) that summarises all the ills of bad posture by [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/regional/). Bad posture negatively affects your shoulders, neck, hips and especially your back.

Sitting for prolonged periods with bad posture causes the soft discs between our vertebrae to compress unevenly. If you take a sponge and place a weight on one side of it and leave it there for hours, that sponge is going to be malformed. That's exactly what will happen to your discs as well. As someone who has suffered from a prolapsed disc, I can tell you it's no fun at all. Let me reiterate that nobody enjoys pain and suffering.

Here's a [link to instructions on how to perform 17 desk stretches](https://www.officevibe.com/blog/infographic-desk-stretches) by [Officevibe](https://www.officevibe.com). You don't have to do them all at once, just sprinkle them throughout your work day. The improved blood circulation might even make you smarter.

### 3. Sleep

Most of us don't get enough sleep. I hardly know anybody under the age of 12 who sleeps before 11pm. Maybe that's just the company I keep, but there are many reasons people don't get enough sleep these days. Some of us work late into the night, some of us game late into the night. Working parents usually finish up their day's chores by midnight. I live in Singapore, and we [rank third](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-among-cities-in-the-world-with-least-hours-of-sleep-study) on the list of cities which clock the least number hours of sleep, at 6 hours and 32 minutes.

The problem of sleep deprivation is much worse than just yawning all the time at work. Research has shown that [the effects of sleep deprivation are equivalent to being drunk](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1739867/). The lack of sleep not only affects your motor skills, but your [decision making](http://postcog.ucd.ie/files/Hrrison%20and%20horne.pdf) and [emotional sensitivity](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michele_Ferrara2/publication/41190268_Lack_of_sleep_affects_the_evaluation_of_emotional_stimuli/links/0046352e24d29a2723000000.pdf) as well. In other words, you become a dumb, angry troll.

Changing your sleep habits take some effort though. The general advice is to sleep and wake up at the same time each day, but try to aim for 7.5 hours of sleep. According to Professor Richard Wiseman, a psychology professor at the University of Hertfordshire, our sleep cycles run in 90 minute intervals. Waking up in the middle of those cycles makes us groggy. He also covers some tips on how to sleep better. You can read the full article [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2587568/How-feel-refreshed-little-sleep-MUST-afternoon-nap-Never-wake-tired-again.html)


### 4. Resistance training

Now I'm not referring hefting iron plates and bars at the gym (though if you like to do that, more power to you). I'm talking about having the basic strength and coordination to run and jump. Maybe climb over the occasional railing. And to be able to get right up without much effort after falling down. Human beings were meant to move. You don't have to be athletic, that's a genetic thing, but we should all be able to perform basic human movements.

Our own bodyweight is plenty for some basic exercises. And it doesn't matter if the heaviest weight you're willing to lift is your laptop and you can't do a push-up if your life depended on it. There are progressions for everyone. Can't do a push-up on the ground? Do a wall push-up instead. Can't do a basic squat? Just practice sitting down on your chair very slowly. Can't run? Just take a walk (yes, walking is a form of resistance training).

There are two websites that I recommend you check out if you're interested in learning more. The first is [Nerd Fitness](http://www.nerdfitness.com/) by [Steve Kamb](). He shares a similar philosophy as me in that it's about the small changes that add up to big results. And he covers topics from diet, to exercise and lots of other resources that can help you on your journey. Another site I really love is [GMB fitness](https://gmb.io/). It teaches people how to move better, and essentially better understand and connect with our bodies.

## Wrapping up

There is only one way to build new habits: consistency over time. That's why it's so important to do things that take minimal effort. The less effort an action requires, the higher chance you will do it consistently. Another thing about building new habits is, try not to make drastic changes to all aspects of your life at once. Regardless of whether you mind change in your life or not, [almost any change introduces stress](http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/srrs.htm) to your system. And even [constant low-grade stress is detrimental](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/chronic-stress-can-wreak-havoc-body) to our health. It's better to start small, with minor changes that you barely feel and once that becomes a habit, move on to the next change.

We spend hours maintaining our code and refactoring to make it better and more efficient. We do the same for our computers, optimising our workflows and installing tweaks to eke out those extra seconds of performance. Then it's only right that we put a little effort into keeping our bodies reasonably healthy as well. Unlike code and machines, it's much more costly to fix problems with your health, and quite often the damage is irreversible. If we want to continue to write great code and build cool products, then we should take responsibility for our health, and make sure we can continue to do what we love for decades to come.
