Any website redesign project is a software development project. Agencies who cannot understand this or lack the expertise to handle such projects tend to find themselves in a world of trouble as the project goes on. I'm sure we've all heard the adage "You never get a second chance to make a first impression". In most agencies, the sales and marketing departments are the ones making that first impression with the client. When there is a disconnect between marketing department and the people who create the work, everybody involved will be in for a hard time. 

Go into any pitch or brief for a website project and I'm fairly certain the word "Responsive" will be sprinkled liberally all throughout every conversation during the session. Whether or not everyone in the room fully understands what that word entails, is another thing altogether. But the matter of fact is, with access to the web becoming increasingly ubiquitous on an infinitely wide range of devices, responsive web design is here to stay. I personally can't even remember the last time I built a non-responsive site. 

There are a number of indicators that a responsive redesign project will end up becoming a fire-fight, or even worse, fail altogether. Some of you can probably relate to this quite well. But it is important that we highlight these issues and how to mitigate them. Nobody wants a project to fail, so it's important that we avoid putting ourselves in disadvantageous positions to begin with.

##No clear digital strategy
Having a website does not mean you've "gone digital". Your website is a tool to facilitate the digital experience, but it's really much more than that. I highly recommend everyone who is involved in digital to read and internalise Paul Boag's [Digital Adaptation](http://www.digital-adaptation.com/).

> By forming a digital strategy you have an opportunity to establish a firm direction for your online footprint, rather than being the victim of managerial whims. - Paul Boag

How can you educate the client about something you do not fully understand?
Lack of client education
 - mismatch of expectations

Lack of planning
 - CSS architecture
 - JS architecture
 - Style guides
 - Consistency
Lack of communication
 - Designers design and developers code
 - 
Gross underestimation of time and effort required
 - Business side don't understand what responsive design entails
 - Project is poorly scoped, especially when the estimates are given by a manager who has no experience doing the hands-on work himself. 
Lack of user-testing
 - Ties in to client education
 - First thing to be cut from the budget
 - Building a white elephant
Lack of proper processes
 - Iterative process. Build, test, iterate, build, test, iterate
Not prioritising performance
 - Performance needs to be considered from the beginning and should affect design decisions
Lack of clear business requirements
 - Be very clear on what is needed and what is not
 - What is the underlying reason why this responsive redesign was necessary
