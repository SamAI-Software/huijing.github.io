Any website redesign project is a software development project. Agencies who cannot understand this or lack the expertise to handle such projects tend to find themselves in a world of trouble as the project goes on. I'm sure we've all heard the adage "You never get a second chance to make a first impression". In most agencies, the sales and marketing departments are the ones making that first impression with the client. When there is a disconnect between marketing department and the people who create the work, everybody involved will be in for a hard time. 

Go into any pitch or brief for a website project and I'm fairly certain the word "Responsive" will be sprinkled liberally all throughout every conversation during the session. Whether or not everyone in the room fully understands what that word entails, is another thing altogether. But the matter of fact is, with access to the web becoming increasingly ubiquitous on an infinitely wide range of devices, responsive web design is here to stay. I personally can't even remember the last time I built a non-responsive site. 

There are a number of indicators that a responsive redesign project will end up becoming a fire-fight, or even worse, fail altogether. Some of you can probably relate to this quite well. But it is important that we highlight these issues and how to mitigate them. Nobody wants a project to fail, so it's important that we avoid putting ourselves in disadvantageous positions to begin with.

##No clear digital strategy
Simply having a website or an app or two does not mean you've "gone digital". Your website is a tool to facilitate the digital experience, but a digital transformation is really much more than that. I highly recommend everyone who is involved in digital to read and internalise Paul Boag's [Digital Adaptation](http://www.digital-adaptation.com/).

> By forming a digital strategy you have an opportunity to establish a firm direction for your online footprint, rather than being the victim of managerial whims. - Paul Boag

The decision to implement a responsive website is a solution. But what we need to ask is, was the problem properly defined and does this solution solve it? Without a clear digital strategy, we have no basis on which to make decisions on what the appropriate solutions should be. This is why it is important for senior management to be fully aware and supportive of the organisation's digital strategy. 

All parties involved need to understand that the web is nothing like any other medium. The web is evolving at a neck-breaking pace, it is unpredictable, bordering on chaotic at times. We cannot hope to predict, control and manage this every-changing landscape. It is untenable to apply traditional business strategies, which operate on the premise that you can plan and budget for the next five years, to the web.
 
##Lack of experience and expertise
This is why it is crucial to have an experienced team well-equipped to traverse this landscape. The emphasis here in on team and collaboration across various disciplines. The traditional waterfall approach of having specialists operating in silo and passing on the project from one phase to the next is no longer effective nor relevant.

For an agency who wishes to undertake such projects, it is mandatory that every person involved has strong digital backgrounds. It is not enough to simply understand the digital landscape yourself, clearly articulate the and educate the client. To provide direction on how to navigate a landscape that is in a constant state of flux. Working together with the client to come up with the best approach for solving their business problems.

A responsive website is just one way to cater for mobile consumers. Depending on the nature of the business and the organisation's business strategy and objectives, maybe a native application is a better solution. There is no clear cut answer to which is better. The trick is to assess the needs of the business, then choose the solution with the best fit. Context is everything. The problem must be framed in the context of the organisation in question. 

It takes expertise and experience from the digital team to not only come up with the most appropriate solution, but also, clearly articulate to senior management and relevant stakeholders why the solution was proposed, and how it can benefit the business.

##Mismanagement of expectations
Without the aforementioned experience and expertise in handling responsive web projects, it is inevitable that the estimation of effort required will be terribly off the mark. The web is a reasonably young medium, and there is nothing quite like it. Stakeholders and management, who are not familiar with digital and the web, will not be able to gauge the complexity of the project. The onus thus falls on the digital team, be it internal or external, to flag out the high risk areas, and cater for worst-case scenarios accordingly. 

Client or stakeholder education is of utmost importance at the beginning of the project. This is where expectations are set and impressions are made. The digital team is put in charge of the endeavour because they are supposed to be the experts in this field, and can provide the necessary guidance and direction to move the project forward. 

It is impossible to educate another about something you do not fully understand. When the digital team lacks the requisite skills and experience, resulting in stakeholders with unrealistic expectations, the project will undoubtedly end up being a fire-fight or worse, fail altogether. A poorly scoped project, based on estimates given by someone who has no hands-on experience with the actual work required, is often a recipe for disaster.

##Lack of a big-picture view
A responsive design is more than just displaying content nicely on different screen widths. A successful responsive design is heavily dependent on content, performance and user experience. All three are intertwined, which means that the content strategists, the UX researchers, designers and developers must all be on the same page. It has to be a collaboration across disciplines.

User research will drive the content, which in turn will shape the design, which impacts the architecture and development. Because every role brings something different to the table, communication is key. Developers understand the web more deeply than anyone else, and will be able to provide feedback on the feasibility and implications of certain design decisions. Designers will use their expertise to present the content in a way that best fits each use case. But the key thing here is, communication must take place throughout the process. 

##Building on a poorly planned architecture
Building anything on the web is a software project. 
Lack of planning
 - CSS architecture
 - JS architecture
 - Style guides
 - Consistency
Lack of communication
 - Designers design and developers code
 - 

Lack of user-testing
 - Ties in to client education
 - First thing to be cut from the budget
 - Building a white elephant
Lack of proper processes
 - Iterative process. Build, test, iterate, build, test, iterate
Not prioritising performance
 - Performance needs to be considered from the beginning and should affect design decisions
