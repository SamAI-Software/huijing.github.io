At this point in time, I had a fair number of projects under my belt. However, I still never really got the hang of jQuery. As someone without any background in programming, Javascript just seemed kind of daunting. HTML and CSS was pretty easy to pick up, but Javascript and jQuery just seemed...hard.

The first jQuery learning resource I tried was [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) by [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/). It was very good, and took me through all the basics of jQuery but somehow it didn't stick. In retrospect, I realised that I needed to use what I learned on an actual project before I could really wrap my head around it. My next assignment was actually with the very first client I ever worked with.

This time, the task was to revamp two key sections of the website. If you read my [previous account]({{ site.url }}/blog/the-one-that-came-first/) of the first project, you may remember that this site was a direct port from HTML. There wasn't much design input on our part then, as the objective was to get the site up and functioning. With everything working properly, it was time to implement some design improvements.

When the first iteration of the site was built, all the sections of the site were simply basic pages. All the content was input with the WYSIWYG editor in the body field. A lot of the value proposition was lost in the long block of text. There were no obvious call-to-actions and key information was buried somewhere down the page or only accessible via links within the text.

With only a single body field to work with, content editors were nervous about editing because they were concerned that they would mess up the layout. Most content editors were not very familiar with HTML and relied heavily on the WYSIWYG toolbar to format the long block of content. In an ideal world, I would choose not to include a WYSIWYG editor at all, and let the content editors just focus on content, however, I do realise that the WYSIWYG editor is a "necessary evil" most of the time.

Aside from that, we

This was similar to how I learned HTML and CSS. Multiple different learning resources which taught the same thing in different ways. Next up, [Codeacademy's jQuery track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery).
